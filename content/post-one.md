# üöÄ Introduction to React

React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces,  
particularly single-page applications (SPAs).

It was developed by Facebook and has grown rapidly thanks to its component-based architecture  
and performance efficiency.

## üîç Why Use React?

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state.  
- **Virtual DOM**: Improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.  
- **Reusable Logic**: Use hooks to manage logic across components.
- **Strong Ecosystem**: Works well with tools like Redux, React Router, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: A Simple React Component

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
